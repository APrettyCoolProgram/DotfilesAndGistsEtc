ABOUT THIS FILE
This is a customizable README.md template intended for use with GitHub codebase
repositories. Content is handled by GitHub written in GitHub-flavored Markdown,
while the layout uses HTML. The source contains an abundance of comments blocks,
much like this one, that will walk you through how to use each component.

These comment blocks should be removed prior to publishing your repository.
