# ADDITIONAL READING: codebase-repository-template

A GitHub README.md file can be written in GitHub-flavored Markdown, HTML, or a mix of both. Each of these formats have their advantages and disadvantages, and a well-written README will leverage the strength of each. In order to use this template, you'll need to understand at least the basics of both.

#### What is markdown?
[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. Markdown's key design goal is *readability*. This readme uses GitHub-flavored Markdown, for the README *content*.

#### What is HTML?
[HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. Keep in mind that GitHub README.md files do not fully support HTML syntax - a small subset of HTML tags are allowed. In addition, most HTML structures are either unnecessary (thanks to Markdown), or unsupported. For the most part, this template uses HTML to modify the *layout* of your README, such as complex tables or content positioning
