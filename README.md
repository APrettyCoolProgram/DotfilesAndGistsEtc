This project is a collection of my dotfiles and gists, wrapped in a standard template for a project README.md.

For example, this is the part of the README.md that you would use to describe your project and what it can be used for. Maybe write about why you created the project (I wanted all of my dotfiles and code snippits in one place), or why other people would care about it (they probably don't).

Also, put a screenshot here that does a lets users know what the look-and-feel of your project is - maybe a login screen, or something.

## Features
* Dotfiles for various IDEs and applications
* Useful code snippits written in various languages
* A nice README.md teplate you can use

## Requirements
* A project
* Iime

## Development
Dotfiles & Gists, Etc. is constantly being developed, but there isn't a [development branch](https://github.com/APrettyCoolProgram/dotfiles-gists-etc/tree/development). It also doesn't have an official [release](https://github.com/APrettyCoolProgram/dotfiles-gists-etc/releases). If the project had a [changelog](), or [roadmap](), they would be listed here.

## The Master Project
If this project is part of a larger project, link to that [here]().

## Project Usage
List any instructions/steps to use the project.

### Step One: Code snippits
Be sure to include
<br>
> `code snippets when applicable`

<br>

### Step Two: Screenshots
When possible, include screenshots
<br>

Save the file as "ENVIRONMENT-APPLICATION[-Modules].rcsi", for example: `LIVE-PM-Modules.rcsi`

When you're done, you should have the following files for each environment (replacing "ENVIRONMENT" with "LIVE/UAT/SBOX/BLD"):
* ENVIRONMENT-RADplus.rcsi
* ENVIRONMENT-PM.rcsi
* ENVIRONMENT-PM-Modules.rcsi
* ENVIRONMENT-CWS.rcsi
* ENVIRONMENT-CWS-Modules.rcsi

When you have all of the files (there should be 20 total), copy them to "myAvatool-EnvironmentCompare/AppData/CurentServerInformation/". 

### Step Three: Configurations
If your project allows/requires configuration settings, detail them here.

* **ConfigValue-01**<br>
(*"default_value"*)<br>
This is a configuration setting.<br>

* **ConfigValue-02**<br>
(*"default_value"*)<br>
This is another configuration setting.<br>
