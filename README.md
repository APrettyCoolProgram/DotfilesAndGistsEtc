# Overview
Dotfiles & Gists, Etc. is a collection of various configuration files and code snippits that I've created over the years, and tend to need often. Hopefully others find some value in these files, so feel free to copy/paste/fork/whatever.

In addition, this project contains README template that can be used as a template for your project's README.md. I've spent alot of time trying to create a great README that can be used for a variety of project types. Just copy the text from this README template file into your README, and modify it to fit your project.

### Features
* Dotfiles for various IDEs and applications
* Useful code snippits written in various languages
* A nice README.md template you can use in your project

### Requirements
There aren't any project-specific requirements, but most of the dotfiles/gists do require various packages/applications/frameworks be installed.
