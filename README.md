# BEFORE YOU BEGIN
A GitHub README.md file can be written in GitHub-flavored Markdown, HTML, or a mix of both. Each of these formats have their advantages and disadvantages, and a well-written README will leverage the strength of each. In order to use this template, you'll need to understand at least the basics of both.
