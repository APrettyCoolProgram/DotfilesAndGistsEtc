About AppResource/Cache/

Cached data is:

    1. Data that is available to a project at launch
    2. Data that is not removed/deleted when a projectexits
    3. Data that can be removed without having a detrimental
       effect on a project(i.e. it's optional)

Data that does not meet the above requirements should probably be
stored in "AppData/Temp/".
